We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

The schema of this table is available here.

Let’s begin!

Start by getting a feel for the nomnom table:

SELECT *

What are the column names?

7.
Your coworker Trey can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘meatball’ in it.

Let’s order delivery to the house!

Find all the close by spots in Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown.
