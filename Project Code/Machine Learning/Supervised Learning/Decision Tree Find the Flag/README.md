MACHINE LEARNING: SUPERVISED LEARNING 🤖
Find the Flag
Can you guess which continent this flag comes from?

Flag of Reunion
What are some of the features that would clue you in? Maybe some of the colors are good indicators. The presence or absence of certain shapes could give you a hint. In this project, we’ll use decision trees to try to predict the continent of flags based on several of these features.

We’ll explore which features are the best to use and the best way to create your decision tree.

Investigate the Data
1.
Let’s start by seeing what the data looks like. Begin by loading the data into a variable named flags using Panda’s pd.read_csv() function. The function should take the name of the CSV file you want to load. In this case, our file is named "flags.csv".

We also want row 0 to be used as the header, so include the parameter header = 0.

2.
Take a look at the names of the columns in our DataFrame. These are the features we have available to us. Print flags.columns.

Let’s also take a look at the first few rows of the dataset. Print flags.head().

3.
Many columns contain numbers that don’t make a lot of sense. For example, the third row, which represents Algeria, has a Language of 8. What exactly does that mean?

Take a look at the Attribute Information for this dataset from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.

Using that information along with the printout of flags.head(), can you figure out what landmass Andora is on?

Creating Your Data and Labels
4.
We’re eventually going to use create a decision tree to classify what Landmass a country is on.

Create a variable named labels and set it equal to only the "Landmass" column from flags.

You can grab specific columns from a DataFrame using this syntax:

one_column = df[["A"]]
two_columns = df[["B", "C"]]
In this example, one_column will be a DataFrame of only df‘s "A" column. two_columns will be a DataFrame of the "B" and "C" columns from df.

5.
We have our labels. Now we want to choose which columns will help our decision tree correctly classify those labels.

You could spend a lot of time playing with groups of columns to find the that work best. But for now, let’s see if we can predict where a country is based only on the colors of its flag.

Create a variable named data and set it equal to a DataFrame containing the following columns from flags:

"Red"
"Green"
"Blue"
"Gold"
"White"
"Black"
"Orange"


6.
Finally, let’s split these DataFrames into a training set and test set using the train_test_split() function. This function should take data and labels as parameters. Also include the parameter random_state = 1.

This function returns four values. Name those values train_data, test_data, train_labels, and test_labels in that order.


Make and Test the Model
7.
Create a DecisionTreeClassifier and name it tree. When you create the tree, give it the parameter random_state = 1.


8.
Call tree‘s .fit() method using train_data and train_labels to fit the tree to the training data.


9.
Call .score() using test_data and test_labels. Print the result.

Since there are six possible landmasses, if we randomly guessed, we’d expect to be right about 16% of the time. Did our decision tree beat randomly guessing?

Tuning the Model
10.
We now have a good baseline of how our model performs with these features. Let’s see if we can prune the tree to make it better!

Put your code that creates, trains, and tests the tree inside a for loop that has a variable named i that increases from 1 to 20.

Inside your for loop, when you create tree, give it the parameter max_depth = i.

We’ll now see a printout of how the accuracy changes depending on how large we allow the tree to be.

11.
Rather than printing the score of each tree, let’s graph it! We want the x-axis to show the depth of the tree and the y-axis to show the tree’s score.

To do this, we’ll need to create a list containing all of the scores. Before the for loop, create an empty list named scores. Inside the loop, instead of printing the tree’s score, use .append() to add it to scores.

12.
Let’s now plot our points. Call plt.plot() using two parameters. The first should be the points on the x-axis. In this case, that is range(1, 21). The second should be scores.

Then call plt.show().


13.
Our graph doesn’t really look like we would expect it to. It seems like the depth of the tree isn’t really having an impact on its performance. This might be a good indication that we’re not using enough features.

Let’s add all the features that have to do with shapes to our data. data should now be set equal to:

flags[["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Gold",
 "White", "Black", "Orange",
 "Circles",
"Crosses","Saltires","Quarters","Sunstars",
"Crescent","Triangle"]]
What does your graph look like after making this change?

Explore on Your Own
14.
Nice work! That graph looks more like what we’d expect. If the tree is too short, we’re underfitting and not accurately representing the training data. If the tree is too big, we’re getting too specific and relying too heavily on the training data.

There are a few different ways to extend this project:

Try to classify something else! Rather than predicting the "Landmass" feature, could predict something like the "Language"?
Find a subset of features that work better than what we’re currently using. An important note is that a feature that has categorical data won’t work very well as a feature. For example, we don’t want a decision node to split nodes based on whether the value for "Language" is above or below 5.
Tune more parameters of the model. You can find a description of all the parameters you can tune in the Decision Tree Classifier documentation. For example, see what happens if you tune max_leaf_nodes. Think about whether you would be overfitting or underfitting the data based on how many leaf nodes you allow.
