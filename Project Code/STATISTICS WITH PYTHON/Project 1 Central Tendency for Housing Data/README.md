LEARN STATISTICS WITH PYTHON
Central Tendency for Housing Data
In this project, you will find the mean, median, and mode cost of one-bedroom apartments in three of the five New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.

Using your findings, you will make conclusions about the cost of living in each of the boroughs. We will also discuss an important assumption that we make when we point out differences between the boroughs.

We worked with Streeteasy.com to collect this data. While we will only focus on the cost of one-bedroom apartments, the dataset includes a lot more information if you’re interested in asking your own questions about the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens housing market.

Observing your Data
1.
We’ve imported data about one-bedroom apartments in three of New York City’s boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. We saved the values to:

brooklyn_one_bed
manhattan_one_bed
queens_one_bed
In this project, we only care about the price of apartments, so we saved the price of apartments in each borough to:

brooklyn_price
manhattan_price
queens_price
If you want to see what these arrays look like, you can use print statements to see them in the output terminal.

Find the Mean
2.
Before starting the next few steps, delete any print() statements you’ve added.

Find the average value of one-bedroom apartments in Brooklyn and save the value to brooklyn_mean.




3.
Find the average value of one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan and save the value to manhattan_mean.

4.
Find the average value of one-bedroom apartments in Queens and save the value to queens_mean.

Find the Median
5.
Find the median value of one-bedroom apartments in Brooklyn and save the value to brooklyn_median.

6.
Find the median value of one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan and save the value to manhattan_median.
7.
Find the median value of one-bedroom apartments in Queens and save the value to queens_median


Find the Mode
8.
Find the mode value of one-bedroom apartments in Brooklyn and save the value to brooklyn_mode.

9.
Find the mode value of one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan and save the value to manhattan_mode.
10.
Find the mode value of one-bedroom apartments in Queens and save the value to queens_mode.


What does our data tell us?
11.
Now what?

We don’t find the mean, median, and mode of a dataset for the sake of it.

The point is to make inferences from our data. What can you say about the housing prices in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan? Besides, “It’s really expensive to live in any of them.”

Take a minute to think through it. We added our thoughts to the hint.
12.
Did you make any assumptions when you drew inferences in the previous task?

If so, what assumptions did you make? We added our thoughts to the hint.

13.
Finally, think about what the histogram for each dataset will look like.

If you have the time, take a minute to make a rough sketch of the histograms for the cost of a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.

You can see someone else’s attempt at a sketch of the Brooklyn histogram.

When you’re finished, open the hint to take a look at the actual histograms for Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.
